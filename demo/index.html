        <p>Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY  short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 'I think,  you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'</p>

        <p>'Why?' said the Caterpillar.</p>

        <p>Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any  good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant  state of mind, she turned away.</p>

        <p>'Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. 'I've something important  to say!'</p>

        <p>This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.</p>

        <p>'Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.</p>

        <p>'Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she  could.</p>

        <p>'No,' said the Caterpillar.</p>

        <p>Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and  perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some  minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its  arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you think  you're changed, do you?'</p>
