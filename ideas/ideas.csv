"How to scale a collections as data up and down? How to accommodate top-of-system R1 universities with professional schools, I-schools, etc., and middle-tier, lower-tier, community college, small liberal arts colleges with fewer resources and expertise.","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
Possibly structure the  collections as data  project in two parts: one driven at R1 level and aiming for high on technical/resource curve in order to drive development in 10 years time to point where low end of technical/resource curve will have the tools and protocols.,"Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
"Can there be a network approach for access and discovery? A registry of datasets/collections ready to use (with metadata, context that gives users a sense of possible uses, level of difficulty)? (Dutch example of using FAIR principles to score datasets). (Alternative: give guidance about uses and difficulty of datasets by providing usage precedents--e.g., which has been used for courses, etc.)","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
"Can the conceptual assumptions in the library world about what is a  collection,   archive,   series,  etc. --and then what is a  dataset  -- be made transparent as the preliminary context that users need to understand what they can do with collections as data?","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
"Can we expose/extract  data primitives  (named entities, geographical references, dates, etc.) that would function as a kind of lingua franca for datasets--allowing an initial way for researchers to use data in their own contexts and projects?","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
"Is it possible to create a shared, standard  workbench  that can be embedded in collections-as-data?","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
Follow an annotated workflow approach for describing reproducible or adaptable ways of working with datasets.,"Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
"How can we provide provenance for datasets, and data workflows? (Brown Dog project)","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
Could iPython/Jupyter notebooks be the natural finding aid format for datasets in the future (allowing for description and also custom harvesting/searching/scraping/analysis)?,"Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
How do we deal with the outsize influence of the proprietary databases/datasets in this space?,"Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
"Instead of thinking of  collections/datasets , perhaps think of providing unique IDs for granular data, and constructing datasets on the fly after the fact?","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
We need a logic for where people deposit datasets -- in institutional repository? In a journalÍs Dataverse? In a national or international repository?,"Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
"Can we plan for a future in which it is not datasets but Dockerized containers that are deposited in repositories æ(i.e., entire computing and research workflows, including datasets)?","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
Teach students about appropriate and good data collection/sharing practices.,"Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
