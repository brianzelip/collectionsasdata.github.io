"How to scale a collections as data up and down? How to accommodate top-of-system R1 universities with professional schools, I-schools, etc., and middle-tier, lower-tier, community college, small liberal arts colleges with fewer resources and expertise.","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
Possibly structure the  collections as data  project in two parts: one driven at R1 level and aiming for high on technical/resource curve in order to drive development in 10 years time to point where low end of technical/resource curve will have the tools and protocols.,"Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
"Can there be a network approach for access and discovery? A registry of datasets/collections ready to use (with metadata, context that gives users a sense of possible uses, level of difficulty)? (Dutch example of using FAIR principles to score datasets). (Alternative: give guidance about uses and difficulty of datasets by providing usage precedents--e.g., which has been used for courses, etc.)","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
"Can the conceptual assumptions in the library world about what is a  collection,   archive,   series,  etc. --and then what is a  dataset  -- be made transparent as the preliminary context that users need to understand what they can do with collections as data?","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
"Can we expose/extract  data primitives  (named entities, geographical references, dates, etc.) that would function as a kind of lingua franca for datasets--allowing an initial way for researchers to use data in their own contexts and projects?","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
"Is it possible to create a shared, standard  workbench  that can be embedded in collections-as-data?","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
"How can we provide provenance for datasets, and data workflows? (Brown Dog project)","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
Could iPython/Jupyter notebooks be the natural finding aid format for datasets in the future (allowing for description and also custom harvesting/searching/scraping/analysis)?,"Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
How do we deal with the outsize influence of the proprietary databases/datasets in this space?,"Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
"Instead of thinking of  collections/datasets , perhaps think of providing unique IDs for granular data, and constructing datasets on the fly after the fact?","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
We need a logic for where people deposit datasets -- in institutional repository? In a journalÍs Dataverse? In a national or international repository?,"Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
"Can we plan for a future in which it is not datasets but Dockerized containers that are deposited in repositories æ(i.e., entire computing and research workflows, including datasets)?","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",3/1/17
How can computational research services create better pathways to interpretation through tools and methods for the smooth traversal between “reduction and abstraction” inherent in derivation and aggregation?,Jefferson Bailey,
How can new access models help researchers have greater comfort with technical mediation at multiple levels and with an increasing distance between the granularity and totality of the object(s) of study?,Jefferson Bailey,
"How can programs address the challenges still inherent, even with derived datasets, of limited technical proficiency and local infrastructure?",Jefferson Bailey,
Recent empirical research has confirmed that digital tools and technologies are fundamentally changing how scholars work.[1] Yet the inverse of this relationship has received little attention – how is infrastructure changing to support emergent scholarly practice?,Alexandra Chassanoff,
"How might we envision ways to access born-digital materials?  Relatedly, how might we use born-digital materials in our research? What kinds of questions could be asked and answered from examination of contents of the so-called black box? ",Alexandra Chassanoff,
To what extent will the guidelines that we generate during Always Already Computational take digitization workflows into account? Can we advise libraries and archives on how an understanding of an eventual data framework can be integrated into these workflows such that when requests for funding are made our colleagues can anticipate generating the kinds of data that we will need for a data access environment? ,Tanya Clement,
"How do we account for (new, collective) data collection that accounts for haunting imprints and outright absences in the archives upon which we depend? What are the implications of a lexicon and set of practices/tools that rely upon and reproduce a colonial language of power and entitlement in the digital humanities as we think collectively about best practices to “leverage computational methods and tools to treat digital library collections as data”. ","Gabrielle Coleman, Labanya Mookerjee",
"Not all of the data we create or purchase for Library collections comes in neat multi-gigabyte packages of ordered files: We recently discovered that datasets we had purchased as part of a database licensing negotiation were more shelf ready than machine ready: They currently exist as stacks of hard drives, discs, and other bewildering formats sitting on a book cart. How do we provide access to these data collections?",Harriett Green,
". . . I would ask, how can we conceptualize the full spectrum of data usability? It is not enough for us to digitize the collection materials and for the data to exist on someone’s server:  Usability encompasses data formats, tool interoperability to the negotiated permissions and rights for researchers to share and manipulate data as they engage in analytic workflows. ",Harriett Green,
"If library collections, including but not limited to that of digital repository platforms, are considered (primarily digital repositories are targeted in the proposal), there is a wealth of data and metadata (*data) that already exists. Better yet, memory institutions already work with this *data at scale using traditional and emerging technologies that underpin and are hidden by delivery and discovery interfaces. How can this underlying ecosystem be better leveraged for computational data analysis by researchers? i.e. do we just need to make access to a Solr index publicly available? Can we plug into our library data ETL systems a public Hadoop integration point? Do we need to better document and expose to new communities our existing data APIs or data exchange protocols? ",Christina Harlow,
" . . . what is the responsibility of the originating memory institution to support capture of that computational data output for sake of archiving, reproducibility, discoverability, and expanded *data services?",Christina Harlow,
"Capacious collections data must remember enough and forget enough to be useful. For which terms will we expend the effort to do this reconciliation? Which edge cases will we try to capture in an ever-more-complex data model? Opinions on how to draw that line will frequently set the librarian, the historian, and the machine at cross purposes. Outlining the necessary competencies a collections data production team needs, and the key questions, in order to navigate perspectives must therefore be a crucial output of this forum.",Matthew Lincoln,
