"How to scale a collections as data up and down? How to accommodate top-of-system R1 universities with professional schools, I-schools, etc., and middle-tier, lower-tier, community college, small liberal arts colleges with fewer resources and expertise.","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",
"Can there be a network approach for access and discovery? A registry of datasets/collections ready to use (with metadata, context that gives users a sense of possible uses, level of difficulty)? (Dutch example of using FAIR principles to score datasets). (Alternative: give guidance about uses and difficulty of datasets by providing usage precedents--e.g., which has been used for courses, etc.)","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",
"Can the conceptual assumptions in the library world about what is a  collection,   archive,   series,  etc. --and then what is a  dataset  -- be made transparent as the preliminary context that users need to understand what they can do with collections as data?","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",
"Can we expose/extract  data primitives  (named entities, geographical references, dates, etc.) that would function as a kind of lingua franca for datasets--allowing an initial way for researchers to use data in their own contexts and projects?","Greg Jansen, Lisa Johnston, Matthew Miller, Alan Liu, Mia Ridge",

Recent empirical research has confirmed that digital tools and technologies are fundamentally changing how scholars work. Yet the inverse of this relationship has received little attention how is infrastructure changing to support emergent scholarly practice?,Alexandra Chassanoff,
"How might we envision ways to access born-digital materials? Relatedly, how might we use born-digital materials in our research? What kinds of questions could be asked and answered from examination of contents of the so-called black box? ",Alexandra Chassanoff,
To what extent will the guidelines that we generate during Always Already Computational take digitization workflows into account? Can we advise libraries and archives on how an understanding of an eventual data framework can be integrated into these workflows such that when requests for funding are made our colleagues can anticipate generating the kinds of data that we will need for a data access environment? ,Tanya Clement,
"How do we account for (new, collective) data collection that accounts for haunting imprints and outright absences in the archives upon which we depend? What are the implications of a lexicon and set of practices/tools that rely upon and reproduce a colonial language of power and entitlement in the digital humanities as we think collectively about best practices to –leverage computational methods and tools to treat digital library collections as data. ","Gabrielle Coleman, Labanya Mookerjee",
"Not all of the data we create or purchase for Library collections comes in neat multi-gigabyte packages of ordered files: We recently discovered that datasets we had purchased as part of a database licensing negotiation were more shelf ready than machine ready: They currently exist as stacks of hard drives, discs, and other bewildering formats sitting on a book cart. How do we provide access to these data collections?",Harriett Green,
". . . I would ask, how can we conceptualize the full spectrum of data usability? It is not enough for us to digitize the collection materials and for the data to exist on someone's server:  Usability encompasses data formats, tool interoperability to the negotiated permissions and rights for researchers to share and manipulate data as they engage in analytic workflows. ",Harriett Green,
"If library collections, including but not limited to that of digital repository platforms, are considered (primarily digital repositories are targeted in the proposal), there is a wealth of data and metadata (*data) that already exists. Better yet, memory institutions already work with this *data at scale using traditional and emerging technologies that underpin and are hidden by delivery and discovery interfaces. How can this underlying ecosystem be better leveraged for computational data analysis by researchers? i.e. do we just need to make access to a Solr index publicly available? Can we plug into our library data ETL systems a public Hadoop integration point? Do we need to better document and expose to new communities our existing data APIs or data exchange protocols? ",Christina Harlow,
" . . . what is the responsibility of the originating memory institution to support capture of that computational data output for sake of archiving, reproducibility, discoverability, and expanded *data services?",Christina Harlow,
"Capacious collections data must remember enough and forget enough to be useful. For which terms will we expend the effort to do this reconciliation? Which edge cases will we try to capture in an ever-more-complex data model? Opinions on how to draw that line will frequently set the librarian, the historian, and the machine at cross purposes. Outlining the necessary competencies a collections data production team needs, and the key questions, in order to navigate perspectives must therefore be a crucial output of this forum.",Matthew Lincoln,
"The most potentially kinetic computationally amenable data comes from the conversion and processing of documents themselves. Transforming documents into data at the New York Public Library took the form of small projects that converted special collection materials into datasets through the power of algorithms, staff and the crowd. The results were a domain specific dataset often with a necessarily unique data model. Taking stock of the growing number these datasets we theorized about their possible integration with our traditional metadata systems. Would it be possible to go beyond simply linking to the dataset as a digital asset? If we were to build a RDF metadata system from the ground up could we begin thinking of it as an open-world assumption system where the contents of these datasets could exist alongside traditional bibliographic metadata? ",Matthew Miller,
". . . when thinking about these resources as discrete datasets, what work could be done to improve their use and interoperability? WC3 standards such the VoID Vocabulary provided the means to describe the metadata about datasets. Leveraging such standards and establishing best practices and preferred authorities could we increase access across humanities datasets?",Matthew Miller,
"The topic of preprocessing introduces the question of best practices and standards that could be followed to ensure the broadest access to our datasets. What are some additional use cases that could drive shared best practices or tools for releasing cultural heritage data? Are there more advanced preprocessing that could be done to some of the common archetypical data formats found in libraries, archives and museums? And what sort of resources are required in an organization to process datasets for public consumption? ",Matthew Miller,
Are researchers genuinely invited to engage with library collections as data?,Anna Neatrour,
"What does a digital collections as data repository look like? Providing additional layers and portals that leverage computational exploration to existing collections might serve as an intermediate step. Imagine if text based digital collections also had a Voyant-like layer built into the digital repository itself that researchers could use, along with pre populated queries and visualizations so people at the beginning stages of inquiry could see examples of text analysis.",Anna Neatrour,
"Could our digital repositories provide a mechanism for researchers to curate their own research collections, providing a space where digital library objects could be combined with researcher supplied data?",Anna Neatrour,
" Data without context is meaningless. Data with context but without social awareness is deceptively meaningless. With that deception comes, in the worst case, the use and articulation of argument founded on a lack of understanding and awareness of perpetuating ideas that are intrinsically linked to the creation and curation of said data. A question for this group would be; how do we attempt to preserve that context without overwhelming the user? ",Hannah Skates Kettler,
"How can we integrate generations of high-quality, professionally-created metadata with electronic versions of the object itself? Particularly when copyright comes into play, we can't simply hope for openness; and there's a steep trade-off between the thoroughness of a well-thought-out standard and a simplicity of conception that makes a digital resource useful for (for instance) a graduate student just beginning to get interested in working with large collections.",Ben Schmidt,
"The technical demands of even downloading something like the HTRC EF set exceed both the technical competencies and computing infrastructure of most humanists--I've literally spent several weeks recently, restarting downloads and identifying missing files as I try to fill up a RAID array with several terabytes of data. Processing these files into the raw material of research is even harder. So how do we make collections accessible for work?",Ben Schmidt,
"Expand accessibility of data - (a) creating middleware tools: APIs or a model like Trove Harvester, which enables people build their own API queries and ways to get content(b) Rights statements and access - false claims of copyright, generic statements by libraries that shouldn’t be applied(c) Workflows for remediation for legacy items in the digital collection","John Ajao, Jefferson Bailey, Daniel Fowler, Harriett Green, Anna Neatrour, Tim Sherratt ",
