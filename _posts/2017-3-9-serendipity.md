Last Friday the Collections as Data held its national forum. During the forum we decided to forego a focus on talks and spent the majority of our time in small groups working on the question of collections as data. The project team is currently spending time getting this work into shape fit for public release. If all goes well, hopefully by end of month.

In the interim, we thought it would be fun to create a platform for sharing collections as data ideas - both from the forum and our broader communities. Drawing on Jason Hepplerâ€™s [whatisdigitalhumanities](http://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/), our implementation provides random, serendipitous-like access to collections as data ideas generated leading up to the forum, during the forum, and ...
