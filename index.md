**Collections as Data** aims to foster a strategic approach to developing, describing, providing access to, and encouraging reuse of collections that support computationally-driven research and teaching in areas including but not limited to Digital Humanities, Public History, Digital History, data driven Journalism, Digital Social Science, and Digital Art History. 

The project team is working to iteratively refine and extend collections as data in collaboration with partners across a national collections as data forum, 6 disciplinary and professional conferences, virtual events, and this project site. This project will produce a collections as data framework, use cases and user stories, functional requirements for technical solutions that support collections as data, methods for making these types of collections more discoverable, and a summative white paper.
